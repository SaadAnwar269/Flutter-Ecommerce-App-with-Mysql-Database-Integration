Hi there, 
Saad Anwar here.
This is a short user manual type of thingy. Not so much a user manual however just remember these things when trying to run thr project because it will not connect and retrieve to database immediately. open cmd on your device and type in "ipconfig" . Under that in the IPv4 address: copy that paste that in your "uri" in the pages which contain an IP address string
Please make sure you do this step. the database is also attached u have to import it into the phpmyadmin
Now it should work when run on android studio or VS code
